# HTML-TTL
Another old and abandoned project. I'd say this is the first project I noticed -- even as I was working on it -- my coding skills vastly expanding and taking shape. 
Although abandoned, most of the basic TTL functionality works. Though if I remember correctly, it had a bug where the AND gate couldn't run more than teo inputs without glitching out.
